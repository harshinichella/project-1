  <h1>Quotes that make you think</h1>
  <p>The following quotes are excerpts from Swamychidbhavananda's Book, "Daily Divine Digest." Enjoy!</p>
  <h3>BLISS</h3>   
  <p>Because of Bliss, beings hold on to life. They toil seeking Bliss. In friendship, they find Bliss. They make sacrifice to find bliss. It is Bliss alone that cannot be renounced.</p> 
  <p>"Bliss is reality." - Vedanta</p>
  <h3>ANGER</h3>
  <p>When man becomes a prey to anger he loses all refinement. He turns into a lunatic for the time being. Spoilt ambrosia becomes poison. A sound mind is ambrosia. But when it is tainted with anger it turns into poison. An angry mind vomits vile thoughts. It transmutes the whole system into venom. The food consumed while in anger becomes injurious to health. An angryman's judgement is clouded.</p> 
  <p>"Obstructed desire turns into anger. It is the worst enemy of man." - Vedanta</p>
  <h3>TIME</h3>
  <p>There is no compensation for the loss of time. What is wasted is gone once for all. Time is the interval between two incidents. It is without beginning and end. Man gets his quota in it. Foolish is he who does not know the value of time. He squanders it. Wise is he who accounts for it. By making the best use of time man builds his career. He who knows the value of time has known the secret of life.</p> 
  <p>"I am the mighty world-destroying Time now engaged in wiping out the world." - Bhagavad Gita</p>
  <h3>TRUTHFULNESS</h3>
  <p>The ordinary man thinks that he gains by telling lies. Whereas the profit of truthfulness is incalculable. Clean conscience is the ultimate reward. When the utterance comes into conflict with the occurrence it is a lie. That person is given to truthfulness who relates the happenings exactly as they are. THe unpleasant incidents, the failures and the iniquities are all frankly admitted or confessed by the truthful man. Integrity elevates man to divine.</p> 
  <p>"Do not deviate from truthfulness. Truthfulness builds man's character." - Vedanta</p>
  <h3>COMPANY</h3>
  <p>Gregarious creature that man is, he is in need of company. So let him choose the congenial to his growth. Solitude is sought as a training ground. It is not a lifelong aim. Then man lives in company. Birds of the same feather flock together, is the proverb. A man's make up is known by the sort of company that he seeks. It is the group life that aids the growth of man.</p> 
  <p>"Seek the company of the good and the wise. It protects you and promotes your spiritual career." - Ramakrishna</p>
